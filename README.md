# PC Speaker Music
#### A project implemented during IT studies. The project carried out in a class on low-level programming on a 16-bit microprocessor on the Intel 8086.


## General info
##### The task of the program was to play melodies using the system speaker. The melody is read from a text file where the melody information is stored in RTTTL format (handling of executable file parameters). 
##### While the melody is playing, it is possible to adjust the tempo, pause and end the melody (keyboard operation). Furthermore, when the melody is played, the color of the font in the console changes in tact with the sounds being played.

## Technologies
##### * Turbo Assembler 16-bit

## Setup:
##### To run the program you need to download an emulator of DOS environment - DOSBox:
